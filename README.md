# Week 2 Task: Predictive Modeling for Employee Attrition

## Project Summary
This task uses machine learning to predict employee turnover. By identifying high-risk employees, a company can take proactive steps to improve retention.

## Models Implemented
- **Baseline:** Logistic Regression (with Feature Scaling).
- **Improved:** Random Forest Classifier (Tree-based) for non-linear patterns.

## Technical Details
- **Seed:** `random_state=42` used for reproducibility.
- **Handling Data:** Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables like 'Department' and 'JobRole'.
- **Evaluation:** Used a Confusion Matrix to analyze True Positives (employees correctly identified as leaving).
